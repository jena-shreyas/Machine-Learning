- The directory contains the following two sub-directories for Ques 1 and Ques 2 and the requirements.txt and the report:
- Grp5_Assn1_Q1:  contains the following files:
    - A1_Q1_Decision_Tree.py : python code for decision tree
    - A1_Q1_Output.txt: contains the results of the training on 10 datasplits
    - A1_Q1_BestModel.txt: contains the info of each node of the Best Model (in terms of Accuracy)
    - Dataset_A.csv: Dataset for the problem
    - A1_Q1_depth_vs_acc_plot.png: Plot of accuracy vs depth
- Grp5_Assn1_Q2:
    - Dataset_A.csv : Dataset for the problem
    - A1_Q2_Naive_Bayes.py : python code for Naive Bayes 
    - A1_Q2_Output.txt: : contains the model results
- requirements.txt
- Grp5_Assn1_Report.pdf

## Install the dependencies

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Question 1

```
cd Grp5_Assn1_Q1
python3 A1_Q1_DecisionTree.py
```

>The corresponding output files A1_Q1_Output.txt and A1_Q1_BestModel.txt will be generated after execution of the code

## Running Question 2

```
cd Grp5_Assn1_Q2
python3 A1_Q2_NaiveBayes.py
```

>The corresponding output files A1_Q2_Output.txt will be generated after execution of the code
